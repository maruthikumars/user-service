# user-service
Challenge#1

Given:
-	1M Users in a DB of your selection
-	User has the following attributes: {ID, Name, Age, Address 1, Address 2 }

Implement a working API for a Web UI / Mobile App, that supports the following use cases:
-	Display all users in a table view (Name, Age)
-	Filter the users by last name and age
-	Sort by Name or Age

Nonfunctional requirements:
-	Response time < 1sec

Deliverable:
-	Fully functional API implemented using Java including source codes
-	A simple Web UI (Angular, React) demonstrating the use cases is a plus but not a must.
-	Source code preferable shared on GitHub.

Challenge#2

Write a function that takes a positive integer, N, and returns the maximal product of a set of positive integers whose sum is N. Invalid inputs should return 0, that is non-positive integers or any integer where no set of at least 2 positive addends exists.
For example: Given 8, the result is 18
8 can be written as 2*2*2*2 whose product is 16. However, it can also be written as 3*3*2 whose product is 18.
